TODO
====

* Change anime status pending|watching|completed|onhold|dropped
* Add anime by hand
* Delete anime
* Add custom torrent filter
* Embed ruby and gems with application to make it easy installable
* Or implement features, provided by ruby scripts in objective c
* Or implement features, provided by ruby scripts in python and embed them
  since python is part of OS X distribution, and importing libs
  from relative paths is more easy there, so i can use instead of nokogiri
 
 * from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup

Ideas
=====
